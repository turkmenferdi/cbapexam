    "question": "Which is a limitation of using historical data?",
    "options": [
      "A. May not represent current or future trends",
      "B. Improves forecasting accuracy",
      "C. Supports decision making",
      "D. Reduces uncertainty"

    "question": "Which is a benefit of prototyping?",
    "options": [
      "A. Provides early validation of requirements and user interface",
      "B. Guarantees final design approval",
      "C. Eliminates documentation needs",
      "D. Automatically reduces costs"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Prototyping allows early validation and testing of requirements and user interface concepts before full development begins."

  {
    "question": "Which is an example of a non-functional requirement?",
    "options": [
      "A. Application must support 2000 concurrent users",
      "B. Provide checkout functionality",
      "C. Send shipping notifications",
      "D. Display product images"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Non-functional requirements specify quality attributes and performance criteria - concurrent user capacity is a scalability requirement."

    "question": "Which is a limitation of observation?",
    "options": [
      "A. May influence behavior of those being observed",
      "B. Improves process accuracy",
      "C. Builds understanding",
      "D. Clarifies process steps"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The presence of an observer may cause people to alter their normal behavior patterns, affecting the accuracy of observations."
